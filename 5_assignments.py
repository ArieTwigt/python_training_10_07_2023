# Assignment 1 - Create a conditional statement that indicates if your name starts with an "A or not

#%% a
name = "Arie"

if "a" in name.lower():
    print("Your name begins with an A")

#%% b
if name[0].lower() == "a":
    print("Your name begins with an A")


# Assignment 2 - Create a conditional statement that indicates if your name begins with a vowel. If it does, change it into a non-vowel and otherwise. For example: Arie â€“> Brie or Rose â€“> Aose

if name[0].lower in vowels:
    name = name.replace(name[0], "B")
    print(name)
else:
    name = name.replace(name[0], "A")

    print("It is not")

#%% b

if 18 <= age <= 68:
    print("Your age is between 18 and 68")
